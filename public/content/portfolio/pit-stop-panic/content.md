# Pit Stop Panic

Toss tires at targets to fix a race in disarray and be a _pit stop pro_!

In 2016, a client asked me to develop a game about tossing tires at busted cars to fix them as they cruise by on a racetrack. I worked with him to help shape this design, then set to work on art and programming for the game. _Pit Stop Panic_ features highly replayable arcade fun, a bunch of unlockable vehicles, and online leaderboards.

The game is now available on the Google Play Store - give it a shot and see how you stack up on the scoreboard!
